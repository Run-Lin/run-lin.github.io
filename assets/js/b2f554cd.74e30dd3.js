Instead, create a fork and file a pull request.\\n* When maintaining a branch, merge frequently with the master.\\n* When maintaining a branch, submit pull requests to the master frequently.\\n* If you are working on a bigger issue try to split it up into several smaller issues.\\n* We reserve full and final discretion over whether we will merge a pull request. Adhering to these guidelines is not a complete guarantee that your pull request will be merged.\\n\\n### Make Pull Requests\\nThe code team will monitor all pull requests, we run some code check and test on it. After all tests passed and all the review comments addressed, we will accept the PR.\\n\\nBefore submitting a pull request, please make sure the followings are done:\\n\\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\\n2. Update code or documentation if you have changed APIs.\\n3. Add the copyright notice to the top of any new files you\'ve added.\\n4.
